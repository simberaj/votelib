'''Objects to assign scores to ranks in ranked voting systems such as Borda.

A rank scorer returns a list of numerical scores to be assigned to ranks given
by voters. This is the essence of Borda count system, and rank scorers capture
most of the variations there are in that system.

    participating in the election, which might be relevant for computing the
