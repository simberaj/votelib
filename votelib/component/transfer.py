'''Objects to transfer votes between candidates for transferable vote systems.

Transfers of votes from eliminated and elected candidates to candidates staying
in the contest are an essential part of any transferable vote system,
such as the one of
:class:`votelib.evaluate.sequential.TransferableVoteSelector`.
There are many variants how to achieve this, some are implemented here.

NOTE: The :class:`VoteTransferer` interface is provisional and may be changed
in the future, chiefly to accommodate a wider range of transfer methods (Meek,
Wright...)
