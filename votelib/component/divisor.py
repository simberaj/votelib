'''Divisor functions used in highest-averages proportional voting systems.

This provides arguments for the
:class:`votelib.evaluate.proportional.HighestAverages` evaluator. However,
divisors can be used as a component in many other voting systems,
such as biproportional allocation.

A divisor function takes the order number (usually equal to the number of
seats allocated so far) and returns the divisor by which to divide the number
of votes for the given party or candidate. The party or candidate with the
largest result then gets the next seat.

Some systems use a mathematically defined divisor but artificially change the
result for parties with no seats so far (`order == 0`) to make it harder for
parties to get their seats. Use :func:`modified_first_coef` for that.

All supported divisor functions are assembled in the `DIVISORS` dictionary
keyed by their name. `get()` retrieves from this dictionary by string key;
`construct()` also accepts callables and passes them through.

def huntington_hill(order: int) -> Decimal:
    '''Huntington-Hill divisor.

    The divisors are defined by `sqrt(n*(n+1))`. This means the
    divisor is invalid for the zeroth order (passing a zero gives
    a divisor of zero, which raises an error in the subsequent division)
    and can thus only be used in cases where the first seat is already
    guaranteed (use the `prev_gains` argument for that).

    Used for United States congressional apportionment as of 2020.
