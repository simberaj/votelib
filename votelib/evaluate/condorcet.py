'''Condorcet selection evaluators.

These evaluators work by examining pairwise orderings between candidates
(how many voters prefer one candidate to another), which is also the form of
votes they take in; if you have ranked vote input, use
:class:`votelib.convert.RankedToCondorcetVotes` to convert it first and
account for possible shared rankings and unranked candidates.

All of the methods in this module reliably select a Condorcet winner when there
is one in the input.

These evaluators are considered more advanced in terms of satisfied criteria
than transferable vote systems but still cannot defy some impossibility
theorems such as Arrow's or Gibbard's.

These evaluators only take few parameters; therefore, a dictionary of their
instances with different setups is provided in the ``EVALUATORS`` module
variable.
