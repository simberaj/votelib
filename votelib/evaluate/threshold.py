'''Electoral threshold evaluators and other seatless selectors.

These evaluators mainly serve as auxiliary components (usually preconditions)
in proportional or similar voting systems. They are seatless selectors, which
means they return a list of elected candidates without being given the number
of them to select; that number is determined by other means.
