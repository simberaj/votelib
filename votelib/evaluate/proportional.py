'''Distribution evaluators that are usually called proportional.

This contains the most common distribution evaluators used in party-list
elections that at least aim to be proportional (although some parameter setups
might make the result very nonproportional, such as the Imperiali divisor)
and also some similar, simpler distribution evaluators that aim for strict
proportionality while relaxing some of the constraints of a distribution
evaluator.
