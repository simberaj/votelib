'''Distribution evaluators that are usually called proportional.

This contains the most common distribution evaluators used in party-list
elections that at least aim to be proportional (although some parameter setups
might make the result very nonproportional, such as the Imperiali divisor)
and also some similar, simpler distribution evaluators that aim for strict
proportionality while relaxing some of the constraints of a distribution
evaluator.

class BiproportionalEvaluator:
    '''Allocate seats biproportionally to parties and constituencies.

    Biproportional apportionment is a method to provide proportional election
    results in two dimensions - constituencies and parties (candidates).
    It works by computing the proportional result using a highest averages
    method along one dimension (here: parties) and then iteratively updating it
    until proportionality is also reached for constituencies, in a process that
    somehow resembles iterative proportional fitting (IPF) but for integer
    values.

    There are two main biproportional apportionment algorithms - alternate
    scaling (AS), which is known to be faster in initial stages but also to
    stall in some corner cases, and tie-and-transfer (TT), which is slower but
    robust. Here, tie-and-transfer (TT) is implemented as described in [#puk]_.

    So far, the only studied variant of biproportional apportionment uses
    highest averages methods, but usually in an alternative specification by
    rounding rules (also called signpost sequences). These rounding rules have
    only been found for D'Hondt and Sainte-Laguë divisors; for other divisors,
    the implementation is missing yet.

    :param divisor_function: A callable producing the divisor from the number
        of seats awarded to the contestant so far, in the same form accepted
        by :class:`HighestAverages`.
    :param apportioner: An optional distribution evaluator to allocate seats to
        constituencies according to the total numbers of votes cast in each.
        Can also be an integer stating the uniformly valid number of seats for
        each constituency, or a dictionary giving the numbers per constituency.
        If None, the number of seats must be specified to :meth:`evaluate`,
        or the highest averages evaluator defined by *divisor_function* is
        used.
    :param signpost_q: The signpost function subtraction constant, which
        defines the rounding. For D'Hondt and Sainte-Laguë divisors, this is
        automatically determined; for other divisors, it must be specified
        manually.
