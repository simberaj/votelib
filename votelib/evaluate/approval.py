'''Advanced approval voting methods.

This module contains approval voting evaluators that cannot be reduced to
a plurality evaluation by aggregating the scores. Use
:class:`votelib.convert.ApprovalToSimpleVotes` in conjunction with
:class:`votelib.evaluate.Plurality` to evaluate simple approval voting (AV)
or satisfaction approval voting (SAV).

class ProportionalApproval:
    '''Proportional Approval Voting (PAV) evaluator. [#wpav]_

    This method uses approval votes (voters select one or more permissible
    candidates) and evaluates the satisfaction of voters with each of the
    combinations of elected candidates. The satisfaction for each voter is
    given as the sum of reciprocals from 1 to N, where N is the number of
    elected candidates that the voter approved of.

    WARNING: Due to the enumeration of all candidate set combinations, this
    method is highly computationally expensive (``O(n!)`` in the number of
    candidates) and infeasible on common machines for more than a handful of
    candidates.

    Tie breaking not implemented - the method itself does not provide a way
    to do it, a dedicated tie breaker will probably be necessary.

class SequentialProportionalApproval:
    '''Sequential Proportional Approval Voting (SPAV) evaluator. [#wspav]_

    This method uses approval votes (voters select one or more permissible
    candidates) but evaluates them iteratively, unlike proportional approval
    voting. In each iteration, the best candidate is selected and all ballots
    that approve of them are reduced in value to ``1/n``, where ``n`` is the
    number of the candidates on that ballot already elected plus one (the
    value of those votes thus decreases to a half after one of the marked
    candidates is elected, to a third if a second one is elected, and so on).

class QuotaSelector:
    '''Quota threshold (plurality) selector.

    Elects candidates with more (or also equally many, depending on
    *accept_equal*) votes than the specified quota.
    This often gives fewer candidates than the number of seats, and thus
    usually needs to be accompanied by an another evaluation step. In very rare
    cases, it might select more candidates than the number of seats.

    This is a component in the following systems:

    -   *Two-round runoff* (usually with the Droop quota and a single seat)
        where it gives the first-round winner if they have a majority of votes,
        and no one otherwise.

    It can also serve as a threshold evaluator (eliminator) in proportional
    systems that restrict the first party seat from being a remainder seat,
    or a kickstart for Huntington-Hill related methods that are not defined
    for zero-seat parties.

        total number of votes and number of seats.

        quota threshold (this is known to produce some instabilities).
    :param on_more_over_quota: How to handle the case when more candidates

        -   ``'error'``: raise a :class:`core.VotingSystemError`,
