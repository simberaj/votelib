'''Cardinal voting systems - systems that use score votes.

These systems have the most complicated input - each voter can assign a range
of scores to candidates - but are claimed to circumvent the Arrow's
impossibility theorem and Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem (but not the more
general Gibbard's theorem) that only hold generally for ordinal (ranked) voting
systems.

    Parameters other than tie_breaking are passed to
    :class:`convert.ScoreToSimpleVotes`.

    Note: This evaluator does not return elected candidates in order of
    precedence (it does not resolve their exact ordering).

    :param tie_breaking: Method of breaking ties for candidates with equal
        median ranking. The `'default'` method (original by Balinski) removes
        median votes until a group of N winners has a higher ranking
        (known to be susceptible to electing candidates with consolidated bases
        rather than candidates with broad support),
        the `'plus'` method by Bosworth selects N candidates with the greatest
        number of scores equal or higher than the median (which claims to
        address the above shortcoming).
    :param unscored_value: Score to give to a candidate that was not assigned
        a score by the voter. None means such ballots will not be considered
        for the candidate. A function can be specified to determine the value
        from all assigned scores (such as assigning the minimum). Builtin
        functions and functions from the statistics stdlib module can be
        specified by their names.
    :param min_count: Minimum count of voter scores for the candidate to be
        considered. Candidates below this threshold will be assigned
        bottom_value.
    :param truncation: Fraction (if lower than 1) or count (if at least 1)
        of lowest and highest scores to disregard before aggregating, to
        stabilize the result. (Both ends are trimmed using this, so the
        number/fraction of scores disregarded is twice the count/fraction.)
    :param bottom_value: Value to assign to candidates with less voter scores
        than min_count. This would usually be the lowest possible aggregate

class STAR:
    '''Score Then Automatic Run-Off (STAR) cardinal voting system.

    A score-based voting system that aims to reduce suceptibility to tactical
    voting by forcing a run-off between the highest-ranked candidates.

    STAR voting is normally specified for single-winner elections only, with
    two candidates in the run-off, but here it is extended:

    -   To enable multi-winner selections (n_seats more than 1), the run-off is
        performed using a selected Condorcet evaluator based on pairwise score
        preferences. This gives an identical result to simple plurality
        evaluation with only two candidates in the run-off, but also creates a
        robust result when there are more.
    -   Finer control over the run-off size is allowed; you can specify more
        than one extra candidate in the run-off, or specify the run-off size
        as a fraction of the number of seats to be filled.

    For single-winner elections, keep the runoff_added_* parameters at their
    defaults; then, the choice of runoff_evaluator does not matter because all
    Condorcet evaluators behave the same for two-candidate elections.

    :param runoff_added_count: Number of extra candidates in the run-off (added
        to the number of seats to be filled) as an absolute number.
    :param runoff_added_fraction: Number of extra candidates in the run-off
        (added to the number of seats to be filled) as a fraction of the number
        of seats to be filled.
    :param runoff_evaluator: Name of the Condorcet evaluator to use for the
        run-off (references `condorcet.EVALUATORS`), or an instance of such a
        selector (must accept votes in pairwise win format).
    :param unscored_value: Score to give to a candidate that was not assigned
        a score by the voter. None means such ballots will not be considered
        for the candidate. A callable is not accepted.
    :param min_count: Minimum count of voter scores for the candidate to be
        considered. Candidates below this threshold will be assigned
        bottom_value.
    :param truncation: Fraction (if lower than 1) or count (if at least 1)
        of lowest and highest scores to disregard before aggregating, to
        stabilize the result. (Both ends are trimmed using this, so the
        number/fraction of scores disregarded is twice the count/fraction.)
    :param bottom_value: Value to assign to candidates with less voter scores
        than min_count. This would usually be the lowest possible aggregate
        score.
