    -   *Single non-transferable vote* (SNTV) for multiple seats and one vote
        per voter.
    -   *Plurality-at-large* (multiple non-transferable vote) for
        multiple seats and number of votes equal the number of seats.
    -   *Limited voting* for multiple seats
        and number of votes per voter fixed and less than the number of seats.
    -   *Cumulative voting*, a very similar variant where the number of
        available votes per voter is not tied to the number of candidates
        or seats.
    -   *Approval voting* (AV) for number of available votes per voter equal
        to the number of candidates (but not the more advanced variants
        of approval voting such as proportional approval voting - see the
        :mod:`approval` for that). A multiwinner variant of approval voting
        is sometimes called block approval voting and exhibits very different
        properties. Use :class:`convert.ApprovalToSimpleVotes` to convert
        approval votes to a simple votes accepted by this evaluator.
    -   *Satisfaction approval voting* (SAV), with one arbitrarily splittable
        vote per voter. Use :class:`convert.ApprovalToSimpleVotes` to convert
        approval votes to a simple votes accepted by this evaluator.
    -   *Score voting* after the votes are aggregated by a score vote
        aggregator such as :class:`convert.ScoreToSimpleVotes`
        (:class:`votelib.evaluate.cardinal.ScoreVoting` can be used instead).
