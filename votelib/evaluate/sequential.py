class TransferableVoteSelector:
    '''Select candidates by eliminating and transfering votes among them.

    This is the evaluator for transferable vote selection (since the evaluator
    does not concern itself with restrictions on allowed votes, it covers not
    only single transferable vote systems - STV -, but also potential multiple
    transferable vote systems). Its single-winner
    variant is also called instant-runoff voting (IRV).

    First, this evaluator looks at first-preference votes. If any of the
    candidates has at least a specified quota of votes, they are elected and
    their votes over the quota are redistributed according to their next stated
    preference. If no candidate has the quota, the candidate with the fewest
    currently allocated votes is eliminated and their votes transferred
    according to their next stated preference. Votes that have no further
    stated preferences are called exhausted and are removed from consideration.

    The current version does not use elimination breakpoints.

    :param transferer: An instance determining how much votes for eliminated
        candidates to transfer and to whom. It must provide the
        :class:`transfer.VoteTransferer` interface (experimental, stability
        not guaranteed). The basic vote transfer variants are implemented
        in the :mod:`transfer` module and can be referred to by their names.
    :param retainer: A selector determining which candidates to retain when
        elimination is to be performed (it may accept a number of seats, which
        will correspond to the number of candidates to retain). If not given,
        the candidates with the lowest amounts of votes will be eliminated.
    :param eliminate_step: Determines how many candidates to eliminate whenever
        elimination is to be performed. If a negative integer, determines how
        many candidates to eliminate at each step (the default eliminates one
        candidate at a time). If a positive integer, determines how many
        candidates to retain after elimination - this essentially allows only
        a single elimination and might cause an infinite loop if not used
        properly.
    :param quota_function: A callable producing the quota threshold from the
        total number of votes and number of seats. The common quota functions
        can be referenced by string name from the :mod:`quota` module. If not
        given, no election by quota takes place - the candidates are just
        eliminated until the desired number remains.
    :param accept_quota_equal: Whether to use non-strict comparison for the
        number of votes against the quota.
