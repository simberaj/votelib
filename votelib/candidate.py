'''Candidate specifications and nomination validators.

Contains definitions of candidate types and interfaces (:class:`Candidate`,
:class:`ElectionParty`, :class:`Coalition`), constituencies
(:class:`Constituency`), special vote variants (:class:`NoneOfTheAbove`,
:class:`ReopenNominations`) and candidate/nomination validators
(:class:`BasicNominator`, :class:`PersonNominator`, :class:`PartyNominator`).

In the current version of Votelib, special candidate objects are not
needed (any hashable objects such as strings can be used for most
functionality implemented so far and will continue to be supported by it
in the future). However, some classes specify interface that are required by
a handful of system objects so if you want to use those system objects,
using the subclasses is necessary.

For a particular example of this, the
:class:`votelib.evaluate.threshold.PropertyBracketer` chooses different rules
based on a value of an arbitrary property of the candidate. You can use any
object that has the specified property defined; the classes defined here can be
assigned arbitrary additional properties, so they, too, can be used.
