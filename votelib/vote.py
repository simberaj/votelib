'''Vote type specifications and vote validators.

Vote types vary from system to system and are only loosely tied to the method
of evaluation (usually, the richer vote types can be reduced to use simple
evaluators but not vice versa). The following vote types are recognized by
Votelib:

-   **Simple** votes - a voter votes for a single candidate. Represented by the
    candidate object itself.
-   **Approval** votes - a voter selects a number of candidates and votes for
    them equally. Represented by a frozen set of candidate objects.
-   **Ranked** votes - a voter ranks a number of candidates. Represented by a
    tuple of candidate objects or frozen sets of them (to account for possible
    tied rankings).
-   **Score** votes - a voter assigns a score (label) to a number of
    candidates. The scores might either be selected from a predefined set or
    arbitrary numbers from a range.

Voting systems generally require one of the above types and usually impose
additional restrictions such as minimum and maximum number of candidates voted
for or ranked. These restrictions are handled by parameters accepted by the
vote validators.

Vote validators validate individual votes, i.e. the keys of the dictionaries
that should be passed to the evaluators. If a vote is invalid, they raise a
subclass of :class:`VoteError` (or :class:`CandidateError`, if a candidate
contained in the vote is invalid).
Some converter objects wrap these validators and catch these errors to remove
invalid votes, for example.

    Vote subsetters reduce a single vote (object) to a smaller variant in which
    only a specified subset of candidates is featured.

    votes.

    Vote subsetters should return None if the vote is to be discarded in the

    Subsetted votes are handy in some cases such as tiebreaking. If you need to
    subset an entire voting dictionary, wrap the vote subsetter into an
