class ScoreToSimpleVotes:
    '''Aggregate scores (cardinal votes) to simple votes.

    Useful for score voting (range voting) systems. Note that, if the usual
    central value function such as mean or median are used, this does not
    give scores that could be passed to ordinary magnitude-based evaluators
    since they do not scale with the number of voters.

    This can be used directly in combination with a simple-vote plurality
    evaluator but is also a component in several cardinal vote evaluators.

    The scores can be arbitrary values as long as the aggregation function
    can cope with them, but numeric scores are the most common.

    :param function: A function to aggregate all scores given to a candidate
        to a single score. It can also be specified by name (string); this
        looks into the exact aggregator register in the utility module (which
        reimplements some common aggregation functions to use exact arithmetic,
        such as the mean, which is the default here) and then searches builtin
        functions and the statistics stdlib module namespaces.
    :param unscored_value: Score to give to a candidate that was not assigned
        a score by the voter. None means such ballots will not be considered
        for the candidate. A function can be specified to determine the value
        from all assigned scores (such as assigning the minimum). Builtin
        functions and functions from the statistics stdlib module can be
        specified by their names.
    :param min_count: Minimum count of voter scores for the candidate to be
        considered. Candidates below this threshold will be assigned
        bottom_value.
    :param truncation: Fraction (if lower than 1) or count (if at least 1)
        of lowest and highest scores to disregard before aggregating, to
        stabilize the result. (Both ends are trimmed using this, so the
        number/fraction of scores disregarded is twice the count/fraction).
    :param bottom_value: Value to assign to candidates with less voter scores
        than min_count. This would usually be the lowest possible aggregate
        score.
