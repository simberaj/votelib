"""Measure proportionality of election results.

These functions evaluate how proportionally the seats are allocated to parties
according to their votes received. For a review of such indicators, see
[#polrep]_ or [#kalog]_.

The functions only accept votes in simple format. To evaluate
disproportionality for elections using other vote types, you must use an
appropriate converter first; however, using the index for those election
systems might not be meaningful.

The seat counts must be in a dictionary format as returned by votelib's
distributors.
